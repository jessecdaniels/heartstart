# HeartStart

Simple Start to a Healthy Heart Website. The purpose of the website to help give consumers grocery substitutions for high sodium products with low to no sodium alternatives. The website will also continue to be updated with more products and more infor about the authors personal low sodium lifetstyle journey. 

A note about salt and our diet. Salt makes your body hold on to water. If you eat too much salt, the extra water stored in your body raises your blood pressure. ... The higher your blood pressure, the greater the strain on your heart, arteries, kidneys and brain. This can lead to heart attacks, strokes, dementia and kidney disease. This website aims to help others start at the grocery store and make some low sodium choices over salty mainstays. 
 
### Browser Compatibilty

I have succesfully tested the site on the current releases of Safari, Chrome, Internet Explorer and Mozzila. I have also tested on Mac iOS as well as Android devices. 
 
### Features

The contact form validates user input with the javascript file by indicating whether the user has left out their first name, last name or email address. The form also has a spam question which validates whether the user is able to answer the simple math question. I designed the website for mobile first and am using media queries to resize for different viewports. The site also uses a grid + flexbox layout. The site is a single page website where the navigation links references a position further down the website.
