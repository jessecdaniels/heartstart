			<h2>Simple Swaps for Healthy Hearts!</h2>
			<p>OH NO! You have just been told by your doctor that you have high blood pressure, diabetes or a heart condition. Or maybe you just want to be little bit healthier and stay ahead of mother nature.</p>
			<p>In a world where we are bombarded with unsolicited health advice, trendy cleanses, and miracle weight loss products, how can we separate fact from fiction.</p> 
			<p>There are many important changes you can make to have a healthy heart, but focus on heart health for many starts at the grocery store.</p>
			<p>Don't think that you have to make big changes to have an effect on your heart health, though. Even small, basic steps can have dramatic effects.</p>
