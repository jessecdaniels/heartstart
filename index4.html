        <h2>Simple Swaps for Healthy Hearts!</h2>
        <p>OH NO! You have just been told by your doctor that you have high blood pressure, diabetes or a heart condition. Or maybe you just want to be little bit healthier and stay ahead of mother nature.</p>
        <p>In a world where we are bombarded with unsolicited health advice, trendy cleanses, and miracle weight loss products, how can we separate fact from fiction.</p> 
        <p>There are many important changes you can make to have a healthy heart, but focus on heart health for many starts at the grocery store.</p>
        <p>Don't think that you have to make big changes to have an effect on your heart health, though. Even small, basic steps can have dramatic effects.</p>

        <h2>PRO TIP!</h2>
        <p>If you can make it in your own kitchen you make it no sodium</p>
        <p>It is simply not realistic to make EVERYTHING, that is not a realistic approach to making life long sodium changes</p> 
        <p>We wanted to provide a resource where consumers can see some easy swaps you can make at the grocery store and in your cooking that will instantly lower your sodium intake and increase the health of your heart.</p>
			  <p>It is not hard to find great products to replace your overly salty standards. Once you make these changes at home your taste buds will thank and in 21 days you will break your salt addiction. 
			  <p>Food will actually taste better and you will appreciate other flavor profiles you may have never explored. So donâ€™t look at these changes as missing out but as focusing on your long term health and well being.</p>
			  <p>When most people go low sodium they complain of missing flavor in their food. That is why a good place to start with your swaps is in the condiment section</p>
